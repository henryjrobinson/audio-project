## Key Innovations

### 1. Dual-Agent AI System

**Real-Time Agent** (during conversations):
```
User: "Grandma loved to cook"
Agent: "What was her specialty?"
User: "Peach pie"
Agent: "Tell me about the first time you tasted it"
```

**Batch Orchestration Agent** (overnight analysis):
```
Analyzes all family contributions
↓
Discovers: "Cooking mentioned 7 times by 4 people"
↓
Creates theme: "Grandma's Southern Cooking"
↓
Prompts family:
  - "Grandma: Share the peach pie recipe"
  - "Sarah: Upload photos from Sunday dinners"
  - "Kids: What's your favorite meal Grandma makes?"
```

### 2. Emergent Theme Discovery
AI automatically identifies patterns:
- "Grandma's Cooking" (from 7 contributions)
- "Moving from South to North" (from 3 stories)
- "Raising 5 Kids in the 1960s" (from 4 perspectives)

Each theme becomes a mini-collection with:
- Related stories from multiple people
- Gaps identified
- Personalized prompts to fill gaps
- Multiple output formats

### 3. Multi-Perspective Stories
**One event, many viewpoints**:
- Mom's perspective
- Dad's perspective
- Kids' memories
- Grandchildren's retelling

AI synthesizes while preserving each voice.
