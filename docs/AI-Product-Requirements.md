1. About
High-Level Problem Space
TLDR: Adult children desperately want to preserve their aging parents' stories and voices before it's too late, but current solutions require writing/typing that elderly parents can't or won't do. [TBD] uses AI-powered voice conversations to capture, transcribe, and transform these precious memories into beautiful keepsakes, eliminating the #1 regret at funerals: "I wish I had recorded their voice."
We're building a done-for-you service that removes all friction from family legacy preservation, targeting the critical window when families realize time is running out but while meaningful conversation is still possible.

3. The Problem
Use Cases
Urgent Legacy Capture: Parent diagnosed with terminal illness, family needs to preserve memories quickly
Cognitive Decline Documentation: Early dementia/Alzheimer's diagnosis, capture stories while still possible
Geographic Bridge: Adult children living far from parents want meaningful connection and preservation - More interactive, more interactive, family trivia, fun, family together. The family makes the prompts and the senior person answers etc.
Milestone Gift: 80th birthday, retirement, or grandchild birth triggers legacy project
Estate Planning Addition: Families doing wills/trusts realize the need for emotional legacy too - Need to listen to your crazy aunt otherwise you won’t get her money.
Monetize the data (with permission etc.)
Pain Points
"Writing is impossible" - Elderly parents can't/won't type or write long stories
"We're running out of time" - Cognitive decline creating urgency without clear action
"I don't know what to ask" - Families lack structure for meaningful conversations
"Current tools keep failing" - StoryWorth loses data, others too complex
"It's too expensive/complicated" - Professional biographers cost $1000s
"One more thing I don't have time for" - Overwhelmed caregivers can't add another tas
Renting the services of the agent. The workflow is to convert the agent into the professional writer/storyteller. Instead of buying a professional service, you purchase the skills you want for the agent.
Basic one - listens, transcribes, organises facts and stories
Enhanced - Biographer, Photographer, Cookbook, AI Generated Objects etc.
Skills = workflows

Press Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
[TBD] Helps Families Preserve Parents' Voices Before It's Too Late
New AI-Powered Service Eliminates the #1 Regret at Funerals: "I Wish I Had Recorded Their Voice"
MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA - September 15, 2025 - [TBD] today announced a breakthrough service that uses artificial intelligence to help adult children preserve their aging parents' stories, voices, and memories through simple phone conversations. Unlike existing solutions that require elderly parents to write or type, [TBD]'s AI conducts natural, warm conversations that capture a lifetime of experiences without any technical barriers.
The service addresses a profound problem: 70% of families never capture their elderly parents' stories before death or cognitive decline makes it impossible. The result is lasting regret, with "I wish I had recorded their voice" being the most common expression at funerals.
"When my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, I panicked knowing his stories were disappearing," said Sarah Mitchell, a [TBD] customer from Ohio. "We tried StoryWorth but he couldn't type anymore. [TBD]'s AI had beautiful phone conversations with him, and now we have a gorgeous book and his actual voice preserved forever. It's priceless."
[TBD] works simply: Adult children sign up online, schedule phone calls for their parent, and [TBD]'s AI handles everything else. The AI conducts warm, adaptive conversations that draw out meaningful stories, automatically transcribes and organizes the content, and creates both physical books and digital archives. Families can review and approve content through a simple web portal.
"We built [TBD] because we experienced this pain personally," said [Founder Name], CEO of [TBD]. "After losing several family members and realizing how little we knew about their lives, we knew there had to be a better way. AI makes it possible to preserve these precious stories at scale, without barriers."
The service is particularly valuable for families facing:
Terminal illness diagnoses
Early-stage Alzheimer's or dementia
Geographic separation from aging parents
The desire to create meaningful legacy gifts
Key features include:
Natural AI phone conversations (no apps or typing required)
Automatic transcription and story organization
Beautiful printed books and digital archives
Voice preservation for future generations
Family collaboration portal
Rush delivery for urgent situations
Pricing starts at $199 for the basic package, with premium options available for extended conversations and rush delivery. This is comparable to existing services like StoryWorth but with the critical advantage of being voice-first and requiring zero technical skills from elderly parents.
Early customer results are exceptional, with 80% of families who begin the process completing their legacy project, compared to just 40% for writing-based alternatives. Customer satisfaction scores exceed 90%, with most customers becoming active advocates for the service.
[TBD] is currently available nationwide and has already helped over 500 families preserve their loved ones' stories. The company plans to expand internationally and add support for multiple languages in 2025.

APPENDIX
MYLIFE: STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLANNING FRAMEWORK
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: WHAT WE'VE LEARNED
Through systematic customer research and market validation, we've transformed MyLife from an undefined memory preservation concept into a clear, validated business opportunity: A voice-first, AI-powered service that helps adult children preserve their aging parents' stories before cognitive decline or death makes it impossible.

PART 1: PROBLEM DEFINITION - VALIDATED ✓

Market Evidence
70% of families never capture parent memories before death
"Before it's too late" appears in 80%+ of discussions
45% triggered by medical diagnosis (terminal illness, dementia)
"Voice is the memory we miss most" - top preservation priority
The Customer Pain Hierarchy (Validated)
Primary Pain: "My parent is declining and I'm running out of time" (Acute, actionable)

THE STRATEGIC CLARITY WE'VE ACHIEVED
We Can Now Answer in One Sentence:
What are we? "We're the voice-first service that preserves aging parents' stories before it's too late"
Who needs us most? "Adult children whose parents just received a terminal or cognitive decline diagnosis"
Why do we win? "Because only we combine AI conversations with zero friction for elderly parents"
How do we grow? "Every saved family refers two more families facing the same crisis"
When do we platform? "After 10,000 families, when we have network effects"
Where's the money? "Adult children pay $199-499 for peace of mind"
What's the moat? "The more families we serve, the better our AI and the stronger our trust"

KEY INSIGHTS THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING
"Before it's too late" is THE message - This phrase appears in 80% of discussions
Voice matters more than stories - "Voice is what we miss most"
Adult children buy, parents participate - Like funerals, service is for the living
Crisis creates willingness to pay - Terminal diagnosis = premium pricing accepted
StoryWorth's weakness is our opportunity - Writing requirement excludes most elderly

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR INVESTORS
The Opportunity:
Massive, validated market pain (70% failure rate)
Clear solution with proven demand
Vulnerable incumbent (StoryWorth)
Premium pricing accepted
Natural viral growth
The Ask:
$3M seed round
18-month runway

Category leadership position
The Vision:

Expand: Proactive family platform
Future: Digital legacy standard
Exit: Strategic acquisition or IPO

FINAL STRATEGIC CLARITY
We are building exactly what the market told us they desperately need: A simple, voice-first way for adult children to preserve their parents' stories during the critical window between diagnosis and death.
Everything else is noise. This is the business.


Appendix - Research Documentation and Interview Transcripts

HRP/Dandelion Focus Group, September 10, 2025
Summary
Dandelion Focus Group - Key Insights Extraction
Technical Challenges
Significant audio issues throughout the session - participants had difficulty hearing due to air conditioning noise and computer at max volume
HDMI connection problems delayed start by approximately 10 minutes
Participants requested larger text display multiple times
Clear need for accessibility features identified immediately
Participant Demographics
6 participants present (one additional expected but arrived late - James Bull/Wood)
Age range: 73-84 years old
All residing at a senior living facility (The Village/Sonic Village)
Diverse geographic backgrounds: North Dakota, Iowa, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, Chicago, Washington DC, Montreal
Professional backgrounds included: telecommunications industry, English teacher (38 years), Air Force (25 years), IT software development (40 years), computer-based training developer/government contractor
Critical Finding: Limited Grandchildren Engagement
Grandchildren Reality Check
Only 2 out of 6 participants had grandchildren
Both reported minimal engagement from grandchildren:
James: "My grandchildren very seldom speak to me. They just keep me posted on where they're at. And that's probably once every three months or so."
Pete: "I have a granddaughter but you know, they live in Colorado and I don't see her very often... she's currently all interested in her friends... Doesn't really spend much time talking."
This represents a major challenge to the assumed family-driven adoption model
Current Memory Preservation Behaviors
Physical Items Brought from Home

Ability to group related memories: "How can I pick out these different chunks... I want to talk about I want I can see where this, this and this get to come together"
Concern about future-proofing: "technology changes its delivering methods so quickly that if you really want people 50 years from now to know about this"
Interface Interaction Observations
Participants immediately asked about ability to change topics mid-conversation
Wanted to upload photos during storytelling ("would you like to see a picture? Here's a picture of the car")

2. 	Voice recordings on phone - DIY approach [5][3][28]
3. 	Video interviews - Family-conducted sessions [29][30][13]
4. 	Remento - Voice-to-text service [2][31][32]
5. 	Professional storytelling services - Hired professionals [10][33]
Top 5 Frustrations with Current Approaches
1.  	StoryWorth platform reliability - Stories lost, no backup [26][4][34]
2. 	Writing requirement barrier - Elderly struggle with typing [25][31][27]
3. 	Expensive additional copies - $99+ per extra book [25][35]
4. 	Technology complexity - Too difficult for elderly users [11][12]
5. 	Poor customer service - Generic responses, no solutions [26][31][4]
Price Points Mentioned
·   	StoryWorth base subscription: $99/year (generally accepted) [25][35]
·   	StoryWorth additional books: $99+ each (major complaint) [25][35]
·   	Professional services: $500-2,000+ [10][33]
·   	DIY solutions: Free-$50 [5][7]
·   	Crisis situations increase willingness to pay significantly
·   	Adult children often buyers, less price-sensitive than elderly
Emotional Journey Map
Trigger → Research → Action Pattern:
1.  	Initial Trigger: Health scare/family event → "I should do something"
2. 	Research Phase: Explore options → Analysis paralysis
3. 	Procurement Delay: "I'll do it later" → Months/years pass
4. 	Crisis Point: Condition worsens → Urgent action needed
5. 	Implementation: Often rushed, incomplete, or too late
6. 	Post-Experience: Deep regret if missed; relief and evangelism if successful
Key Validation Signals
Market Need Confirmed:
·   	50+ relevant discussions found across platforms expressing urgent need [1][2][29][30][5][3]
·   	High emotional stakes drive action and willingness to pay
·   	Clear trigger events create predictable demand patterns
·   	Strong word-of-mouth potential from success/regret stories
Competitive Vulnerabilities:
·   	StoryWorth dominance vulnerable due to data loss issues [26][4][34]
·   	Remento's AI writing doesn't feel authentic to users [31]
·   	Professional services too expensive for most families
·   	DIY solutions lack organization and polish
Unmet Market Gaps:
·   	Reliable, elderly-friendly voice preservation
·   	Authentic voice capture (not AI-generated content)
·   	Affordable family sharing (multiple copies)
·   	Searchable, organized content
·   	Works with reluctant participants
Competitive Intelligence Summary
StoryWorth: Market leader but vulnerable - major data loss complaints, writing requirement excludes many elderly, expensive additional copies [25][26][4][27]
Remento: Growing alternative but AI writing doesn't capture authentic voice [31][32]
HereAfter.AI: Interactive voice bot but limited to pre-recorded responses [36][37][38]
FamilySearch: Free but complex, genealogy-focused rather than story-focused [39][40][41]
Professional Services: High quality but $500-2000+ pricing excludes most families [10][33]
Market Segmentation Identified
1.  	Crisis Mode: Terminal diagnosis, urgent timeline, high emotional intensity, highest willingness to pay
2. 	Proactive Planners: Healthy elderly, long timeline, methodical approach, price-sensitive
3. 	Reactive Preservers: Post-loss regret, creating for future generations, guilt-motivated
4. 	Family Coordinators: Adult children managing elderly parents' participation, less price-sensitive
Key Opportunity Insights
The research reveals a massive validated market opportunity with clear pain points, emotional triggers, and willingness to pay. The dominant player (StoryWorth) has significant vulnerabilities, particularly around reliability and accessibility for elderly users. There's strong demand for authentic voice preservation solutions that work for reluctant participants and don't require technical skills.
The regret-based emotional triggers are extremely powerful, with "before it's too late" messaging consistently driving action across multiple platforms and user segments.

Based on extensive research across Reddit communities and online forums from the past 2 years, I've compiled comprehensive findings on how adult children discuss memory preservation for aging/ill parents. The research reveals profound emotional patterns, clear market opportunities, and specific language that drives action.
PART 4: Synthesis of Key Findings
Top 10 Most Common Phrases Describing the Problem
"I wish I had asked" - Most frequent regret expression across all platforms
"Before it's too late" - Primary urgency driver appearing in 80%+ of posts
"Running out of time" - Consistent panic language when decline noticed
"Voice is the memory we miss most" - Top priority for preservation
"She had progressed really far and only had about five of the same stories" - Cognitive decline reality
"I realized there were so many things I never knew about his life" - Discovery urgency
"One more thing that you don't have time for" - Caregiver overwhelm expression
"I would've taken more photos, more videos, I would've recorded his voice" - Post-loss regret
"Don't know where to start" - Paralysis point language
"My dad passed away last year, and I never did those recordings" - Ultimate regret statement
