# Persona Dashboard Specifications
## Family-Oriented Storytelling Interface

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

Based on the V2 architecture and product requirements, Voice Legacy needs **4 distinct dashboard experiences** tailored to different family member roles. Each persona has unique needs, capabilities, and ways of contributing to the family archive.

### Key Insights from Requirements

From [AI-Product-Requirements.md](./AI-Product-Requirements.md):
- "Geographic Bridge: Adult children living far from parents want meaningful connection"
- "More interactive, family trivia, fun, family together"
- **"The family makes the prompts and the senior person answers"**
- Focus on voice-first, minimal tech burden for elderly

From [ARCHITECTURE_V2.md](./ARCHITECTURE_V2.md):
- Multi-contributor platform where **everyone contributes**
- AI discovers themes and generates personalized prompts
- Multi-perspective storytelling
- Family collaboration is core

### 3. Chatbot Writing Assistance

**For elderly or anyone who wants help:**

Conversation flow:
```
User: [Clicks "Write Story with AI Help"]

Chatbot: "I'd love to help you write this story! What memory would you like to share?"

User: "I want to write about my mother's peach pie"

Chatbot: "Wonderful! Let's start with this: What's the first thing you remember about her peach pie?"

User: "The smell when she'd bake it on Sundays"

Chatbot: "Beautiful! Here's a draft based on what you told me:

'Every Sunday, the house would fill with the sweet smell of my mother's peach pie baking...'

Would you like me to:
• Add more details about the smell
• Ask you more questions to expand this
• Keep writing and I'll tell you more"

[Iterative process continues]
```

### 4. AI Theme & Prompt Generation

**Visible to all personas (in different ways):**

**For Owners**: Full dashboard of themes, gaps, suggestions
**For Contributors**: Personalized "what you can add"
**For Elderly**: "Your family wants to know about..."
**For Viewers**: "Explore these discovered themes"

Example AI-Generated Prompts:
```
Theme: "Grandma's Southern Cooking" (85% complete)

AI Analysis:
• 7 contributions from 4 family members
• Mentioned: biscuits (5x), peach pie (4x), Sunday dinners (3x)
• Missing: Actual recipes, cooking process, where she learned

Personalized Prompts Generated:
→ To Grandma: "You've mentioned your peach pie 4 times! Could you share the recipe and how you learned to make it?"
→ To Sarah: "You talked about Sunday dinners - do you have any photos from those times?"
→ To Michael: "What was your favorite thing Grandma cooked?"
→ To Everyone: "Who has Grandma's handwritten recipe cards? Please photograph and upload!"
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Routing Structure
```typescript
// src/App.tsx routes
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<DashboardRouter />} />

// DashboardRouter determines which dashboard based on role
function DashboardRouter() {
  const userRole = getUserRole(); // 'owner' | 'subject' | 'contributor' | 'viewer'

  switch(userRole) {
    case 'owner':
      return <OwnerDashboard />;
    case 'subject':
      return <ElderlyDashboard />;
    case 'contributor':
      return <ContributorDashboard />;
    case 'viewer':
      return <ViewerDashboard />;
  }
}
```

### Mock Data Extensions

```typescript
// Mock topic suggestions
interface MockTopicSuggestion {
  id: string;
  topic: string;
  suggestedBy: string;
  votes: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'answered';
}

// Mock AI prompts (personalized per user)
interface MockAIPrompt {
  id: string;
  forUser: string;  // Member ID
  type: 'fill_gap' | 'add_detail' | 'suggest_media';
  content: string;
  relatedTheme?: string;
}

// Mock themes with completeness
interface MockTheme {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  completeness: number;  // 0-100
  contributionCount: number;
  gaps: string[];  // What's missing
  contributors: string[];
}
```

5. Grandma: "Well, you need really ripe peaches"
6. Chatbot: "Perfect! Let me write that down. Then what?"

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Phase 1**: Create ElderlyDashboard with basic recording + prompts
2. **Phase 2**: Create ContributorDashboard with topic suggestions
3. **Phase 3**: Create ViewerDashboard with theme exploration
4. **Phase 4**: Enhance OwnerDashboard with AI insights tab
5. **Phase 5**: Build shared components (AddContent, TopicSuggestion)
6. **Phase 6**: Integrate chatbot writing assistance throughout

Each phase should include mock data and be fully testable standalone.
