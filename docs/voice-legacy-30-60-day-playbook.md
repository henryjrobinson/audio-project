# Voice Legacy: 30-60 Day Launch Playbook
## From Analysis to Revenue in 8 Weeks

### Week 0: Reality Check & Decision Points

**STOP CONDITIONS** (If any are true, pivot immediately):
- You can't get 10 people to talk to you about their aging parents in 48 hours
- You personally don't feel the pain (no emotional connection = dead startup)
- You discover someone already solved this perfectly (check: StoryWorth, Remento, HereAfter)

**GO CONDITIONS** (All must be true):
- You can articulate the problem in one sentence that makes people nod
- You have access to 50+ potential customers (adult children 40-65)
- You can dedicate 40+ hours/week for next 60 days

## Days 1-7: Validate the Knife-Twist Problem

### The "Mom Test" Validation Sprint

**Goal**: Confirm people will pay $199-499 to preserve parent's voice

**Actions**:
1. **Post in 3 places TODAY**:
   - NextDoor: "Research study: How do you preserve your parent's memories?"
   - Facebook local groups: "Looking for 10 people whose parents are 70+ for 15-min paid interview ($20 Amazon gift card)"
   - LinkedIn: "Working on elderly parent memory preservation - who's dealt with this?"

2. **Interview Script** (15 minutes max):
   ```
   "Tell me about the last time you visited your parents"
   "What worries you most about them aging?"
   [Listen for memory/story loss organically]
   "Have you tried to preserve their stories? What happened?"
   "What would you pay to have their voice and stories preserved forever?"
   ```

3. **Success Metrics**:
   - 7/10 mention memory loss unprompted
   - 5/10 have tried and failed to preserve
   - 3/10 say they'd pay $200+

**PIVOT TRIGGER**: If <50% recognize problem, you're solving wrong problem

   - One testimonial (even if fake, mark as "simulated")
   - $199 early bird price (50% off "future price")
   - Simple intake form

   - Otter.ai for transcription ($10/month)
   - ChatGPT Plus for story extraction ($20/month)

   - You use ChatGPT to extract stories
   - You create book in Canva
   - You send PDF + audio file

**Total Tech Cost**: $76/month

## Co-founder Considerations

### Do You Even Need One?

**You DON'T need a co-founder if**:
- You can sell (getting customers)
- You can use no-code tools
- You have 6 months runway

**You DO need a co-founder if**:
- You can't code AND can't sell
- You need emotional support
- You have zero network

### Finding the Right One

**Week 1-2**: Work alone first
**Week 3-4**: If struggling, start conversations
**Week 5-8**: Trial period with 2-3 candidates

**The Test**: Can they get 3 customers or build the MVP in 2 weeks?

### Equity Split Framework

**If they join Days 1-30**:
- Equal partners: 50/50
- Use 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- Document everything

**If they join Days 31-60**:
- You keep 60-70%
- They get 30-40%
- Based on their contribution

**Red Flags**:
- Want equity before contributing
- Can't commit full-time within 30 days
- Disagree on core vision

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### "But I need to build more features!"
**Reality**: You need customers, not features
**Solution**: Manually deliver value, automate later

### "But someone might steal my idea!"
**Reality**: Ideas are worthless, execution is everything
**Solution**: Move fast, get customers, build moat through relationships

### "But it's not scalable!"
**Reality**: Nothing is scalable at first
**Solution**: Do things that don't scale (Paul Graham)

### "But I need a technical co-founder!"
**Reality**: You need customers first
**Solution**: Wizard of Oz it, hire dev after proving demand

## The 60-Day Success Formula

1. **Days 1-7**: Validate people will pay
2. **Days 8-14**: Build manual MVP
3. **Days 15-21**: Get 3 paying customers
4. **Days 22-30**: Perfect experience with intense feedback
5. **Days 31-45**: Scale to 10 customers
6. **Days 46-60**: Decide to scale, bootstrap, or pivot

## The Bottom Line

By Day 60, you'll know:
- If this business is real (10 paying customers)
- If you want to do this (you've lived it for 60 days)
- If it can scale (unit economics proven)

**Stop planning. Start executing. The market will tell you everything you need to know.**
