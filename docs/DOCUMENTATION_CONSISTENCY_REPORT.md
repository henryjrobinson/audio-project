## Deprecated Documentation (For Historical Reference Only)

### ⚠️ V1-Focused Documents

These documents describe the original V1 architecture (interview-focused service) and have been superseded by V2 (collaborative family platform). They are kept for historical context but should **NOT be used for implementation**.

| Document | Superseded By | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **[PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md](./PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md)** | [PRODUCT_ROADMAP_V2.md](./PRODUCT_ROADMAP_V2.md) | ⚠️ OUTDATED - Collapsed with deprecation notice |
| **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** | [ARCHITECTURE_V2.md](./ARCHITECTURE_V2.md) | ⚠️ PARTIALLY OUTDATED - Tech stack still relevant, data models outdated |

**Changes Made**:
- Added prominent deprecation notices at top of files
- Wrapped original content in `<details>` tags (collapsed by default)
- Added links to current V2 documents
- Specified what parts are still relevant vs outdated

## Key Strategic Decisions Documented

### ✅ Build Standalone V2, Integrate with MyLife Later

**Rationale** (from MYLIFE_PLATFORM_ANALYSIS.md):
- Faster to MVP (8 weeks vs 6-9 weeks to refactor for MyLife)
- Full control over roadmap and technology choices
- Technology stack validated by MyLife (80% alignment)
- Can add MyLife integration post-MVP via SSO/export connectors
- Focus on our differentiators: family collaboration, audio recording, AI orchestration

### ✅ Technology Stack Validated

**Stack** (from V2_IMPLEMENTATION_READINESS.md):
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + shadcn/ui + Tailwind
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 + Whisper (consider Claude 3.5 as alternative)
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) - adopted from MyLife's Dandelion
- **Auth**: JWT (standalone) or Firebase (for MyLife integration)

**Validation**: MyLife platform uses same core stack (Node, Postgres, React, SSE), proving our choices work at scale.

### ✅ 8-Week MVP Scope

**Phases** (from PRODUCT_ROADMAP_V2.md):
1. **Week 1-2**: Foundation (auth, archives, invitations)
2. **Week 3-4**: Recording Magic (AI conversation, transcription)
3. **Week 5**: Group Recording (multi-speaker support)
4. **Week 6-7**: AI Orchestration (themes, prompts)
5. **Week 8**: Polish & Beta Prep

**Post-MVP**:
- Phone/video calls (Twilio)
- Real-time streaming (OpenAI Realtime API)
- Collections (books, albums, videos)
- MyLife integration (optional)

---

## Adoption from MyLife Platform

### Immediate Adoptions (Week 1-3)

1. **✅ Server-Sent Events (SSE)** - Replace polling with SSE for AI responses
   - **Source**: Dandelion Memory Keeper proves this works
   - **Impact**: Better UX, less server load
   - **Implementation**: Week 3 (recording feature)

2. **✅ Dual-Agent Pattern** - Conversation + extraction agents in parallel
   - **Source**: Dandelion uses Collaborator + Memory Keeper
   - **Enhancement**: Add Recording → Transcription → Themes → Prompts pipeline

3. **⚠️ Claude 3.5 Consideration** - Benchmark vs GPT-4
   - **Source**: Dandelion uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku successfully
   - **Impact**: Potentially cheaper, similar quality
   - **Action**: Test during Week 3 implementation

### Post-MVP Considerations

- **NANDA MCP Integration** - Multi-provider AI orchestration (if we expand beyond OpenAI)
- **Firebase SSO** - Login with MyLife account
- **Docker Deployment** - MyLife uses Docker, we should add Dockerfile

## Competitive Positioning

### Voice Legacy V2 vs Dandelion Memory Keeper

| Feature | Dandelion | Voice Legacy V2 | Advantage |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| AI Conversation | ✅ Claude 3.5 | ✅ GPT-4 | Equivalent |
| Real-time Streaming | ✅ SSE | ✅ SSE (Week 3) | Equivalent |
| Recording | ❌ Text only | ✅ Audio/Video/Photo | **Our advantage** |
| Family Collaboration | ❌ Individual | ✅ Multi-member archives | **Our magic** |
| Group Recording | ❌ | ✅ Multi-speaker (Week 5) | **Our magic** |
| AI Themes | ❌ | ✅ Batch discovery (Week 6-7) | **Our advantage** |
| Personalized Prompts | ❌ | ✅ Per-member (Week 7) | **Our advantage** |
| Database | ⚠️ In-memory | ✅ Postgres + Prisma | Our advantage |
| Deployment | ✅ Render | ✅ Render/Railway | Equivalent |

**Bottom Line**: Dandelion captures individual memories. We capture **family stories across generations with AI-orchestrated engagement**.

## Recommendations for AI Assistants

When asked about Voice Legacy, prioritize reading in this order:

### For Implementation Questions:
1. **V2_IMPLEMENTATION_READINESS.md** - Current state, Week 1 tasks
2. **PRODUCT_ROADMAP_V2.md** - Week-by-week plan
3. **MASTER_FEATURE_LIST.md** - Detailed feature specs

### For Architecture Questions:
1. **ARCHITECTURE_V2.md** - V2 technical design
2. **MYLIFE_PLATFORM_ANALYSIS.md** - Technology validation

### For Strategy Questions:
1. **PRODUCT_VISION_V2.md** - Business model, pricing
2. **MYLIFE_PLATFORM_ANALYSIS.md** - Competitive positioning

### ⚠️ Ignore These for Current Implementation:
- ~~PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md~~ (superseded by V2 version)
- ~~ARCHITECTURE.md~~ data models (use ARCHITECTURE_V2.md instead)

---

## Next Steps

### For Development (Week 1)
1. Read [V2_IMPLEMENTATION_READINESS.md](./V2_IMPLEMENTATION_READINESS.md)
2. Follow Week 1 checklist:
   - Set up environment (.env files)
   - Run database migration (Prisma schema)
   - Implement auth endpoints
   - Create family archive CRUD
   - Build invitation system

### For Strategic Review
1. Read [MYLIFE_PLATFORM_ANALYSIS.md](./MYLIFE_PLATFORM_ANALYSIS.md)
2. Consider: Should we adopt SSE in Week 3? (Recommendation: Yes)
3. Consider: Should we benchmark Claude 3.5 vs GPT-4? (Recommendation: Yes, Week 3)
