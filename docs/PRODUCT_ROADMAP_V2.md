## üö® Risk Management

### **Technical Risks**

#### **üî¥ HIGH: AI Latency Too Slow**
- **Impact**: Recording experience feels broken, users abandon
- **Probability**: Medium (30%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with 30-second chunks (acceptable latency)
  - Optimize prompts for speed
  - Cache common responses
  - Fallback to async processing
- **Contingency**: Allow users to record, process later

#### **üî¥ HIGH: AI Quality Inconsistent**
- **Impact**: Generated stories unusable, themes nonsensical
- **Probability**: Medium (40%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Extensive prompt engineering
  - Human review before approval
  - A/B test prompts
  - Allow regeneration
- **Contingency**: Manual story editing, theme curation

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM: Processing Queue Backlog**
- **Impact**: Stories take hours to process, frustrating UX
- **Probability**: Medium (30%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Horizontal scaling (more workers)
  - Priority queue (new users first)
  - Monitor queue depth
  - Set processing limits
- **Contingency**: Batch processing overnight only

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM: Browser Recording Compatibility**
- **Impact**: Doesn't work on iOS, Android, or certain browsers
- **Probability**: Low (20%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Test early on all platforms
  - Provide polyfills
  - Clear browser requirements
- **Contingency**: Manual upload option always available

### **Product Risks**

#### **üî¥ HIGH: Users Don't Invite Family**
- **Impact**: Single-contributor archives, V2 value not realized
- **Probability**: High (50%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Make invitation extremely easy
  - Show value of multi-contributor
  - Prompts remind to invite
  - Sample archives show multi-contributor power
- **Contingency**: Product works great with 1 contributor (fallback to V1)

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM: Elderly Can't Use Interface**
- **Impact**: Primary subjects unable to participate
- **Probability**: Medium (40%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Simplified elderly dashboard
  - Large fonts, high contrast
  - Phone recording option (post-MVP)
  - Family assists with recording
- **Contingency**: Family records elderly, uploads for them

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM: Feature Complexity Overwhelms**
- **Impact**: Users confused, abandon platform
- **Probability**: Medium (30%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Progressive disclosure
  - Clear onboarding
  - Tooltips and help
  - Simple default mode
- **Contingency**: "Simple mode" toggle

### **Business Risks**

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM: Beta Signups Too Low**
- **Impact**: Not enough users to validate, slow iteration
- **Probability**: Medium (30%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Pre-launch waitlist
  - Partnerships with senior orgs
  - Personal network outreach
  - Social media campaign
- **Contingency**: Extend beta timeline, recruit more aggressively

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM: API Costs Exceed Budget**
- **Impact**: Can't afford to scale, shut down features
- **Probability**: Low (20%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Set daily spend limits
  - Monitor usage closely
  - Optimize prompts for efficiency
  - Cache aggressively
- **Contingency**: Limit free tier usage, introduce pricing earlier

## üéØ Final Thoughts

This roadmap balances **ambition** with **realism**:

‚úÖ **Ambitious**: Full V2 vision with AI magic
‚úÖ **Realistic**: 8 weeks for core features, defer advanced features

### **Key Success Factors**

1. **Stay focused**: Ruthlessly prioritize P0 features
2. **Ship weekly**: Deploy frequently, iterate fast
3. **Test early**: Don't wait for Week 8 to test
4. **Listen to users**: Beta feedback is gold
5. **Maintain quality**: AI magic only works if it's actually magical

### **What Makes This Work**

- **Clear scope**: 14 epics, well-defined
- **Realistic timeline**: 8 weeks for MVP, not production
- **Phased approach**: Foundation ‚Üí Recording ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Orchestration
- **Focus on magic**: AI guidance, themes, prompts (not just CRUD)
- **Built-in testing**: Week 8 dedicated to polish

### **The North Star**

Every week, ask: **"Can a family capture and organize their stories better than last week?"**

If yes, you're on track. If no, re-prioritize.

**Let's build something magical.** üöÄ
